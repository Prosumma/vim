vim
===

My .vim. Probably not interesting to anyone but me, except that I have a custom [pgsql.vim](https://github.com/Revolucent/vim/blob/master/syntax/pgsql.vim) for highlighting PostgreSQL which I think is _much_ better than any other I've seen out there, though I admit it is not perfect. It does syntax highlighting for PLPGSQL inside function definitions as long as $$ is used as the delimiter.

Note that I started with [Derek Wyatt](https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-config)'s vim config and went from there.
